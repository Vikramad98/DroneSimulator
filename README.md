# Drone Simulator

This is a drone simulator application developed using unity 3D and C# programming language.
User/player can build the .exe file through Unity 3D game engine.
User can use W,A,S,D keys for controlling a drone.
I have added a nice Home UI using which user can interact with the buttons to start and for enabling and disabling a audio.
